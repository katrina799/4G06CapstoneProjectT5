\section{CICD}

In the project's CI/CD pipeline, the Main CI GitHub Action is configured to validate that the Python code adheres to PEP 8 standards, ensuring consistent code style across the project. Additionally, the PR Checks Action verifies that each pull request is properly labeled and linked to relevant issues. This ensures that every PR is easily reviewable and contains sufficient context for team members, aligning with the project's quality expectations and contributing guidelines.
