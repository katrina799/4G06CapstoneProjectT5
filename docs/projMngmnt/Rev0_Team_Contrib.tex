\section{CICD}

\textbf{Continuous Integration}: As team members contribute code to our repository, each push triggers automated tests to run (using GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI). This ensures that new code does not break or degrade the functionality of the existing system.

\textbf{Continuous Deployment}: Once the code passes all tests in the integration stage, it can be automatically deployed to a staging environment where it can be reviewed in a production-like setting. After approval, the code can be deployed to the production environment, making the changes live for our users.
