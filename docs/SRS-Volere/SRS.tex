    \item The implementation of a new system may change the way students interact with existing tools and platforms. If the new tool enables seamless integration with existing popular scheduling platforms, users may stop using other scheduling tools. Some users may need to adapt to these changes, and this transition needs to be handled carefully to ensure a smooth user experience.

    \item The data security requirements of the new tool and the user access control may require changes to the current security infrastructure. Any potential impact on existing security protocols should be fully assessed, and measures taken to mitigate risks.

    \item The new system may change user workflows and procedures. If it automates and prioritizes tasks, this may impact the way they plan and manage assignment completion and course scheduling. Understanding and responding to these changes as early as possible is critical to ensure smooth operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\subsection{Idea 1}
\textbf{Requirement}: \frref{R_upload_pdf}, The user could upload multiple PDF files containing course outlines to the system. \\
\textbf{Potential solution}: We could use a \textit{Python} web framework \textit{Flask} to set up a web app which supports accessing and uploading multiple files with PDF extensions.\\
\textbf{Advantages}: This will allow users to upload their PDF easily and more securely, and with no additional effort required for developers to implement and test these features, as \textit{Flask} has already taken care of it for us.\\
\textbf{Disadvantages}: Using \textit{Flask} to support this feature doesn't present any foreseeable disadvantages in the near future. \\

\subsection{Idea 2}
\textbf{Requirement}: \frref{R_prioritize_task}, The system could assign priority to each task generated. \\
\textbf{Potential solution}: A inference pipeline could be set up to give inference on the unclassified tasks using type of task, weight, and deadline as the inputs. The inference pipeline could use a trained model of task priority classification.\\
\textbf{Advantages}: Setting an inference pipeline could be more flexible and could potentially give better results than implementing an fixed algorithm for giving predictions. Several steps for the inference pipeline could be constructed and it will be easier to make changes once it gets set up, simply adding, changing or removing steps when there is a future requirement.\\
\textbf{Disadvantages}: There will be an overload of defining each step and connecting them. \\

\subsection{Idea 3}
\textbf{Requirement}: \frref{R_check_task_progress}, The user should be able to view the progress of each task. \\
\textbf{Potential solution}: Could implement a cloud based solution for holding and retrieving data of task, time, etc. A potential choice could be using \textit{AWS S3}\\
\textbf{Advantages}: This would allow users to check their progress of task and time in a more available, reliable, and well-managed service. The data can be well secured and can be accessed in many ways for example using \textit{AWS S3}, \textit{AWS console}, \textit{AWS Command Line}, providing multiple ways for developers to implement  \\
\textbf{Disadvantages}: There is a cost associated with it when using third party cloud services
