\section{The Scope of the Work}

\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, students across various educational levels face significant challenges in managing their academic tasks and schedules effectively due to the overwhelming schoolwork. Teachers and educational institutions also seek innovative solutions to foster management skills among students and enhance their learning experiences. The existing solutions are often not comprehensive, lacking intelligent task prioritization, progress visualization, and effective time management tools.

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The Smart Study Helper App is designed to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly platform that combines automated task generation, intelligent task prioritization, progress visualization, and various other features. The development of this application intends to improve students' academic performance and mental well-being by reducing stress and enhancing learning experiences.

\section{The Scope of the Product}

\subsection{Product Boundary}
The Smart Study Helper App aims to serve as a comprehensive solution for students to manage their study schedules and tasks effectively. Its boundary extends from user registration, task generation, and prioritization, to progress visualization and study planning. It will interact with external calendar services and will allow users to collaborate with peers through its social network component. However, the app’s boundary does not extend to managing non-academic tasks or any other aspects of a user’s daily life not related to their study.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
