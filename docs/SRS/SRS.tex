    \item The implementation of a new system may change the way students interact with existing tools and platforms. If the new tool enables integration with existing popular scheduling platforms, users may stop using other scheduling tools. Some users may need to adapt to these changes, and this transition needs to be handled carefully to ensure a smooth user experience.

    \item The data security requirements of the new tool and the user access control may require changes to the current security infrastructure. Any potential impact on existing security protocols should be fully assessed, and measures taken to mitigate risks.

    \item The new system may change user workflows and procedures. If it automates and prioritizes tasks, this may impact the way they plan and manage assignment completion and course scheduling. Understanding and responding to these changes as early as possible is critical to ensure smooth operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
This section specifies the interfaces between the new system and existing systems or components.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interface with Google Calendar}: The system should integrate with Google Calendar to synchronize and visualize task deadlines. The interface will involve certification, data exchange, and event management.
    
    \item \textbf{Interface with Outlook Calendar}: Similar to Google Calendar, the system shall integrate with Outlook Calendar to synchronize events. The interface will involve certification and event management.

    \item \textbf{Interface with Machine Learning Server}: The system relies on machine learning algorithms to prioritize tasks. This interface includes sending data to the machine learning server, processing suggestions, and integrating them into the user interface.

    \item \textbf{Interface to connect with users}: To facilitate collaborative learning, the system should enable users to connect with their peers. This interface includes user authentication, data exchange, and video chat integration.

    \item \textbf{Interface with videoconferencing hardware} Users will use webcams, microphones, and speakers for video chat during collaborative learning. This interface is required to access these hardware components and manage live video conferencing.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Confusion}:
    The addition of machine learning-driven task prioritization, facial recognition, and online collaborative learning session features may confuse or create resistance from some users who are unfamiliar with these concepts.
    
    \textbf{Prevention and mitigation measures:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop a user-friendly onboarding process and provide extensive training materials to ensure users can easily understand and use the new features.
        \item Provide customization options that allow users to customize the system to their preferences. This flexibility will help users take better control of their experience.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Privacy Concerns}:
    Users may have privacy concerns, especially with attention-monitoring features such as facial recognition. They may be concerned that their facial data will be collected and used.
    
    \textbf{Prevention and Mitigation Measures:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Privacy concerns are addressed by implementing strong data protection measures. Users will be informed of what their data will be used for and how it will be processed and will be able to opt out of certain features.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Technical Issues}:
    Technical issues or system incompatibilities may lead to adverse reactions, such as issues related to platform support or software bugs.
    
    \textbf{Prevention and Mitigation Measures:}

    \item The planned servers may not have enough processing power or storage capacity to handle the expected growth in users and data volume.
    
    \item Available network bandwidth may not be sufficient to support real-time videoconferencing for collaborative learning sessions, leading to potential performance issues.
    
    \item Implementing system integration with external calendaring platforms (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) takes into account that these platforms may have limitations or constraints that affect the quality of the integration.
    
    \item Hardware for facial recognition may not be readily available or may not meet the accuracy requirements for detecting the user's level of attention.
    
    \item The implementation environment may be subject to specific data privacy regulations that may affect the collection and storage of user data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
This section anticipates potential challenges, unintended consequences, and limitations that the project may encounter during development and implementation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The implementation of new features or technologies in the system may inadvertently result in non-compliance with existing laws and regulations, such as user privacy protection aspect. The project team will conduct regular assessments. Any necessary changes will be made to address potential legal issues.

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\subsection{Idea 1}
\textbf{Requirement}: \frref{R_upload_pdf}, The user could upload multiple PDF files containing course outlines to the system. \\
\textbf{Potential solution}: We could use a \textit{Python} web framework \textit{Flask} to set up a web app which supports accessing and uploading multiple files with PDF extensions.\\
\textbf{Advantages}: This will allow users to upload their PDF easily and more securely, and with no additional effort required for developers to implement and test these features, as \textit{Flask} has already taken care of it for us.\\
\textbf{Disadvantages}: Using \textit{Flask} to support this feature doesn't present any foreseeable disadvantages in the near future. \\

\subsection{Idea 2}
\textbf{Requirement}: \frref{R_prioritize_task}, The system could assign priority to each task generated. \\
\textbf{Potential solution}: A inference pipeline could be set up to give inference on the unclassified tasks using type of task, weight, and deadline as the inputs. The inference pipeline could use a trained model of task priority classification.\\
\textbf{Advantages}: Setting an inference pipeline could be more flexible and could potentially give better results than implementing an fixed algorithm for giving predictions. Several steps for the inference pipeline could be constructed and it will be easier to make changes once it gets set up, simply adding, changing or removing steps when there is a future requirement.\\
\textbf{Disadvantages}: There will be an overload of defining each step and connecting them. \\

\subsection{Idea 3}
\textbf{Requirement}: \frref{R_check_task_progress}, The user should be able to view the progress of each task. \\
\textbf{Potential solution}: Could implement a cloud based solution for holding and retrieving data of task, time, etc. A potential choice could be using \textit{AWS S3}\\
\textbf{Advantages}: This would allow users to check their progress of task and time in a more available, reliable, and well-managed service. The data can be well secured and can be accessed in many ways for example using \textit{AWS S3}, \textit{AWS console}, \textit{AWS Command Line}, providing multiple ways for developers to implement  \\
\textbf{Disadvantages}: There is a cost associated with it when using third party cloud services
