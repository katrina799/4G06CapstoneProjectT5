The project is a time management tool designed to assist students in studying and completing coursework efficiently and in an organized manner.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Team meetings for Team 5 will occur at least three times a week, excluding SFWRENG 4G06 lectures and tutorials.Each meeting will be no longer than 50 minutes in length, with a preference for Microsoft Teams on-line meetings, and the rest of the meetings will take place off-line on the McMaster University campus, and will be held at the following times The meeting time will be chosen from the following time slots that have been agreed upon by the entire team: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tuesday 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
    \item Wednesday 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
    \item Thursday 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
    \item Friday 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
    \item Saturday 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
    \item Sunday 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
\end{itemize}
Meeting Types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sprint Planning Meeting:} 
    This type of meeting is held every two weeks and is primarily used to discuss breaking down work tasks, assigning issue owners, setting issue deadlines, establishing short-term goals and plans, as well as defining the completion criteria and expectations for tasks. Team supervisor will attend this type of meeting.
    \item \textbf{Stand-up Meeting:}
   	This type of meeting takes place three times a week, on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, typically lasting no more than half an hour. It is primarily used for each team member to report on their work for the week, provide updates on progress, outline their next steps, discuss whether they need assistance, and identify any obstacles.
    \item \textbf{General Meeting:}
    The frequency of this type of meeting is random, and sometimes not all team members need to participate. It may involve one-on-one discussions. The primary purpose of this meeting is to quickly address specific details or engage in in-depth discussions about a single issue. Attendees should coordinate whether it's necessary to communicate the key meeting content to the rest of the team.
\end{itemize}
\section{Team Communication Plan}
WeChat is a platform used by the team on a daily basis and this is the quickest way to connect with team members.Z WeChat is mainly used to discuss task assignments, meeting times, meeting locations and meeting durations, brainstorming about the project, and planning extracurricular team building activities. 

To better track project progress and work distributions, we use GitHub to manage issue assignments and deadlines, use GitHub issues to record team meeting notes, and also use GitHub Pull requests to review, modify, and approve PR requests that make changes to the project repository.
