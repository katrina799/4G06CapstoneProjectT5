## Critical Assumptions

</div>

*These assumptions that are made about the software or system. You should minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards. For instance, you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include this potential failure mode.*

## Failure Mode and Effect Analysis

</div>

*Include your FMEA table here.*

## Safety and Security Requirements

</div>

*Newly discovered requirements. These should also be added to the SRS. (A rationale design process how and why to fake it.)*

## Roadmap

</div>

*Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline? Which requirements will be implemented in the future?*
