## Critical Assumptions

</div>

*These assumptions that are made about the software or system. You should minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards. For instance, you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include this potential failure mode.*

## Failure Mode and Effect Analysis

</div>

*Include your FMEA table here.*
