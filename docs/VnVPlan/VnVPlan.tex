\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The verification and validation (V\&V) plan for our project includes ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the V\&V processes themselves. Given the importance of this plan in the overall project quality assurance, the following approaches will be employed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Peer Review:} The V\&V plan will be reviewed by team members and classmates to identify any omissions or areas needing improvement.
    \item \textbf{Mutation Testing:} This technique will be applied to evaluate the ability of our test cases to detect faults deliberately injected into the code.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Feedback Incorporation:} Feedback from all review sessions and testing phases will be systematically incorporated to refine the V\&V plan.
\end{enumerate}

To systematically verify the V\&V plan, the following checklist will be used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the plan comprehensive, covering all aspects of software verification and validation?
    \item Are the responsibilities and roles in the V\&V process clearly defined?
    \item Does the plan include a variety of testing methods (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing)?
    \item Is there a clear process for incorporating feedback and continuous improvement in the V\&V process?
    \item Are there criteria defined for the success of each testing phase?
    \item Is mutation testing included to assess the thoroughness of the test cases?
    \item Are there measures in place to track and resolve any identified issues during the V\&V process?
    \item Does the plan align with the project's schedule, resources, and constraints?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The Implementation Verification Plan will ensure that the software implementation adheres to the requirements and design specifications outlined in the SRS. Key components of this plan include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing:} A comprehensive suite of unit tests, as detailed in the project's test plan, will validate individual components or modules of the software. /textit{PyTest}, a flexible and powerful testing tool, will be used for writing and executing these tests.
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis:} /textit{Pylint} and /textit{Flake8} will be employed for static code analysis to identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and issues with code style and complexity.
    \item \textbf{Code Reviews and Walkthroughs:} Regularly scheduled code reviews and walkthroughs with team members and supervisors to inspect code quality, readability, and adherence to the Flask framework's best practices and design patterns.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration:} Automated build and testing processes will be implemented using tools like GitHub Actions, to ensure continuous code quality, integration, and deployment.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}



  \subsubsection{Authentication}

  \begin{enumerate}
            
  \item{TFR1-A1\\}
  
  Control: Functional, Manual, Dynamic
            
  Initial State: Sign-up page that is used to create an account with username and password
            
  Input: Valid username and password in string format (letters, numbers, etc)
            
  Output: A prompt saying that the account has been created successfully
  
  Test Case Derivation: If the username and password are provided in a valid format, the user should be able to create an account and should be notified that the account has been created
  
  How test will be performed: A list of string pairs with different combinations of letters, and numbers will be given to the function that handles creating an account and we can then check our database if the provided string pairs get saved and if the website is prompting the notification telling the account has been created. 
  
  \item{TFR1-A2\\}
  
  Control: Functional, Manual, Dynamic
            
  Initial State: Sign-up page that is used to create an account with username and password
            
  Input: Invalid username or password (such as empty strings, too few characters, existing username etc.)
            
  Output: A prompt saying that the username or password is invalid with detailed information such as more characters are needed or username/password cannot be empty or the username already exists
  
  Test Case Derivation: If the username and password are provided in an invalid format, the user should be notified with more information
  
  How test will be performed: Invalid usernames and passwords such as empty strings or strings with only a few letters or duplicated usernames will be given to the function that creates an account and we will check if the function throws an exception and if the website is notifying the user to provide valid inputs instead.
  
  \item{TFR2-A3\\}
  
  Control: Functional, Manual, Dynamic
            
  Initial State: Sign-in page that is used to sign in with an existing account that includes placeholders of username and password
            
  Input: Username and password in string format
            
  Output: If the username and password match user data stored in our database, the user should be able to log in and be redirected to the home page, otherwise the user should be prompted saying that the username and password provided do not match
  
  Test Case Derivation: If the username and password match, this means our user is authenticated and hence should be able to log in, authenticated users should be redirected to the home page once logged in for further actions. If the username and password do not match, the user should be prompted in some way to be notified and asked to try again
  
  How test will be performed: A list of usernames and passwords (some of them match mock data stored in our database and some of them are just random strings that are not in our database) should be given to the function that handles user login, and we will check for those that match the mock user data in our database if the website directs to the home page and for those that do not match if the website prompts saying that username and password do not match
  
  \item{TFR3-A4\\}
  
  Control: Functional, Manual, Dynamic

  Input: The notification gets left-clicked and the button rejecting the friend request is clicked
            
  Output: A text or diagram showing that the friend request has been rejected
  
  Test Case Derivation: When the user rejects an incoming friend request, he/she should be notified that it has been rejected when the friend request gets rejected
            
  How test will be performed: Manually log in to one of the mock accounts, send a friend request to another mock account, log in to the account receiving the friend request and then check if there is a notification indicating that there is an incoming friend request, reject the friend request and then see if a text or a diagram gets displayed indicating that the friend request has been rejected

  Control: Functional, Manual, Dynamic
            
  Initial State: The user is logged in and is on the page that displays their tasks and current progress on those tasks
            
  Input: The user can input for each task what their current progress status and then save it
            
  Output: The task list will be updated with the current progress of the task
  
  Test Case Derivation: The user should be able to see a list of the current tasks he has to do and how far along he is on them. He should also be able to manually change the progress for each task when he has made progress or feels he needs more time
            
  How test will be performed: Manually log in and navigate to the task list page, select a task to edit the progress on, and then input a random percentage ranging from 0 to 100, Then, after pressing the save button this change should be committed and reflected on the task list page upon revisiting
  
  \item{TFR15-UI13\\} 
  
  Control: Functional, Manual, Dynamic
            
  Initial State: The user is logged in and is on the page that displays their tasks and current progress on those tasks with a subtask marked as complete and there is a pop-up asking if the pace is comfortable
            
  Input: The user clicks if the pace is comfortable or not on the given pop-up
            
  Output: On clicking that the pace is comfortable, nothing is changed, if the pace is not comfortable the time for each task will change accordingly
  
  Test Case Derivation: The system curates a study plan for the user, so if the user does not feel as if he is doing well with this plan he should be able to provide feedback and have the study plan change around this feedback 
            
  How test will be performed: Manually log in head to the task list and complete a task. On the pop-up showing asking if the pace is comfortable, select that it is comfortable. Then, check that no change has been made to the timeline. Repeat this, but this time select that the pace is not comfortable, and then check that the study plan has changed how much time should be spent on the tasks

  Initial State: The user has logged in and is on the PDF extraction page and has uploaded the course outline PDF
            
  Input: The user presses to extract the course information from the uploaded PDF
            
  Output: The page shows lists the course information extracted from the PDF as a task list
  
  Test Case Derivation: The user should be able to upload his course schedule and have the website extract the necessary information from it in order to create his schedule. After it has extracted the information it should display it to the user for quick verification
            
  How test will be performed: Manually log in and upload a course PDF. Continue and click to parse the course outline and create a task list. Check that the extracted information from the list including \textit{courseName}, \textit{taskType}, \textit{taskName}, weight, and deadline from the uploaded course outline is correctly displayed as a task list

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}



The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
