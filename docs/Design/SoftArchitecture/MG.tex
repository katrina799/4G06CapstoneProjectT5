\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team ~\cite{Parnas1972a}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by ~\citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed ~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUI}:]
The user interface design could be changed, especially the layout, colour, and fonts.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acALGM}:]
The algorithms might be changed, such as the algorithm for PDF extraction and task priority prediction.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDBSCH}:]
The database storage system could be modified, such as the database schema, tables, constraints or other elements.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAPI}:]
The API usage in the back-end system could be upgraded or changed.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSCALE}:]
The web load or data scale could be changed in the development of the application.

\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decisions should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The programming languages and technical stack won't be changed.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The major functionality and purpose of this application won't be changed from educational use to other business use.  
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:]
The deployment of the database on AWS cloud service won't be changed because of high cost.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The application's overall architecture won't be changed dramatically.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:]
The interface device would always be the computer keyboard and monitor.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}
The use hierarchy between these modules is represented using a DAG diagram, which visualizes the interconnections between different modules inside this software application system. Each node represents a module stated in the previous module decomposition section. The edges indicate the dependencies between modules. An arrow from module A to module B implies that module A depends on module B, both the functionality support and data transmission. We can see that the Back End Web Service Module is located as a central node on this diagram, which serves as a communication hub for the breach of sub-system modules.

This diagram reflects several software architecture concepts. Modularity can be easily understood, the information-hiding principle is also an additional effect.  Each module hides its internal details from other modules, and the design idea of loose coupling and high cohesion are proven. Such layer architecture makes this application can be high maintainable and reusable because the changes in one individual module would have little effect on others.

\section{Reflection}
The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Problem Analysis and Design.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What are the limitations of your solution?  Put another way, given
  unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)

  The current scope of our application is very limited because of the cost consideration. If the user amount grows significantly, our backend module may face the condition of overload, and traffic burden. Also, The central module plays a very important role, if it fails, then most functionalities could be affected. Therefore, the current application is not fault-tolerant and error-free. The current module architecture design appears that low flexibility of inner connections between each other, so new features and module additions could be a heavy workload if the new one has close relationships with many modules which need a lot of data transmission and interaction.

  Therefore, if given unlimited resources, a failure-tolerant mechanism system should be deployed for a better user experience. Also, investing in more optimized algorithms with unlimited data resources to do analysis could make our prediction more accurate and increase computing efficiency. Also, to solve the problem of scope limitation, conduct a distributed system to relieve the stress of the server when customer usage is too high.  
  \item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered.  What
  are the benefits and tradeoffs of those other designs compared with the chosen
  design?  From all the potential options, why did you select a documented design?(LO\_Explores)

  Instead of having a centralized back-end service center, the micro-service architecture design could be a valuable approach for a software application, which is composed of small independent services that could communicate over individual APIs. There are many benefits of this design. This design is very flexible, expanding each service to satisfy the specific need, and maintaining good usability. Continuous integration and deployment are also supported. rollback can also be triggered when the error occurs. Because the cost of maintainability for this kind of architecture is low, experiments and new changes are encouraged, then the product release cycle can be highly reduced. 
  
  The reason why we chose our current design is because of the balance between complexity and maintainability.  We conduct modularization but still centralize the back-end service, which eases the build complexity and effort at the initial stage of development while maintaining flexibility. Continuous integration and deployment are supported in our current design system, the decentralized optimization can also easily be brought in the future if necessary.
