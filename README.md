This project is a web-based scheduling application that aims to ease students' stress when facing multiple deadlines. In our objectives, it automatically generates personalised study plan based on uploaded course outline and interact with the user's calendar of choice to ensure no assignments get overdue and dynamically adjust according to the user's progress. 
Students could progress towards their academic success in their own pace and even connect with classmates with similar schedule to have collaborative study sessions.
